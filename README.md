# CSS Isometric Menu

## Overview

This project showcases a menu designed with an isometric perspective using HTML and CSS. The menu items are styled to create a 3D effect, and various CSS transitions enhance user interaction.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the menu.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles that define the appearance and behavior of the menu.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file sets up a list of menu items within an unordered list (`<ul>`), with each item (`<li>`) containing a link (`<a>`). The items are given inline styles to control their z-index for layering effects.

## CSS Styles

The CSS file applies several styles to create the isometric effect:
- **Isometric Perspective**: The menu is skewed to create a 3D effect.
- **Hover Effects**: When a menu item is hovered over, its background color and position change.
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions are applied for visual effects.
- **Shadows**: Shadows are added to enhance depth perception.

## Features

- **Isometric Effect**: The menu items appear in a 3D perspective due to the skew transformation.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Items change color and move when hovered over.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions ensure a smooth visual experience.
- **Depth with Shadows**: Shadows are used to give a sense of depth.

## Dependencies

- **Google Fonts**: The Oswald font is used and imported from Google Fonts.

## Usage

1. **HTML File**: Ensure the `index.html` file is placed in your project directory.
2. **CSS File**: Ensure the `style.css` file is in the same directory or adjust the path in the `<link>` tag of the HTML file accordingly.
3. **View in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the menu in action.
